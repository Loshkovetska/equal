            The civilization of the early third millennium can be described as a Mobile Age. Contemporary people can't imagine their life without a smartphone, whose number is twice as much as the entire population of the Earth and is continuing to grow apace.

            Such a ubiquity of mobile gizmos makes app development a lucrative niche for software companies. All the more so as organizations across various industries and individual users clamor for all kinds of apps to cater to their needs

            <h2>Focusing on Mobile App Categories</h2>
            <p>There are several areas where mobile apps carry the day.</p>
      
      
            <ol>
                <li>Education
                    <p>
                        The global pandemic has put a halter on offline studying but paved the way for remote e-learning where edtech apps hold sway. Such solutions come in dozens of guises – from language learning apps and special courses in various subjects to online tutors and university choosing software. Moreover, they can be tailored to suit learners of all ages – starting from toddlers and finishing with college students.
                    </p>
                </li>
      
                <li>Finance and Banking
                    <p>
                        With smartphones quickly turning into a payment medium, <a href="https://www.equal.design/case/FIG/">fintech apps</a> are gaining enormous traction. Thanks to them, we can pay for groceries, take care of budget management, calculate taxes, sign an order insurance contract, crowdfund a project, and do other financial operations without even visiting a brick-and-mortar bank.
                    </p>
                </li>
      
                <li>Healthcare
                    <p>
                        COVID-19 has given a powerful boost to one more app kind – telehealth ones. They are a second-to-none means of providing video consultations without the need for the patient to come to the hospital and run a risk of contracting a disease. Besides, such solutions can give access to the medical histories of patients, <a href="https://www.equal.design/case/TAKEPILL">remind them to take medications</a>, track their principal health physical metrics (pulse rate, blood pressure, glucose level, etc.), advise on their fitness routine and calorie consumption, and <a href="https://www.equal.design/case/PLEDGER">perform other medicare-related tasks</a>.
                    </p>
                </li>
      
                <li>Social Media
                    <p>
                        In our profoundly digitalized times, most people lead two lives – one physical in the real world and one virtual in social networks. This modern trend explains the popularity of social media apps that rank second-high among other application types.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Such products enable users to share images, post videos, promote conversations, and generally provide wider connections to the people they communicate with on social networks.

                <li>Entertainment
                    <p>
                        These apps are a great crutch when you have to spend long hours waiting – on a cross-ocean jet flight, in-between doing errands, standing in a queue for the dentist, etc. They will keep you from boredom and guarantee an engaging pastime when you can read texts, watch movies, listen to audiobooks, or play games. The latter can be a full-time hobby for many people (younger audiences especially) who can choose among the plethora of game kinds (arcades, shooters, puzzles, quests) that can be played solo or with a group of the birds of your feather.
                    </p>
                </li>
      
                <li>Shopping
                    <p>
                        Buying things online was a widespread approach several years ago, but in the post-COVID next normal, it has become a prevalent approach to shopping. Many an e-commerce mobile app development company offers shoppers all over the world a range of <a href="https://www.equal.design/case/WOODWATCH">e-commerce products</a> to radically streamline this part of our lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make an app of any type attractive and convenient for smartphone owners, you should give serious thought to mobile app interface design.
