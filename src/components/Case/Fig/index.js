Since freelancers can work from anywhere on the planet and in different conditions, the app should be as user-friendly as possible.

      <div class="slide-wrap">  <p class="slide-up">Our specialists have analyzed the initial data and opportunities for project development. Initially, for a consistent movement designers created the site map, determined the basic flow and functions on the main dashboard.<br />
        <br />
        To continue the design process coherently, based on the site map, our designers began to work on the landing page.

      <p class="slide-up">Since going fully Fintech, all transactions and payments are easily accessible to the user on the main financial dashboard. Moreover, depending on the needs at any moment, a user can adjust the input statistics displayed on the screen. The expenditure graph is provided by set filters and criteria specifically. Thus, the user interface both on the main screen and throughout the web app is as native as possible. In terms of user experience design, it can also be related to the overall comprehensibility of the information and features.<br /><br />
      </p>
        <p class="slide-up">To keep the dashboard clean and convenient at the same time, the designers added a fixed bar with basic information about the user and the most necessary data, such as connected freelancer platforms, connected cards, user profile. Freelancers no longer need to track cash flows and transactions on their own, it can all be done in one app to make life easier for users and allow them to use their money efficiently. It is a thing!

        Designing a dark mode for the application saves battery power and reduces eye strain for users, which makes an overall impact on the user experience.</p>
