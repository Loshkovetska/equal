<div class="slide-wrap slide-up"> <strong>In times of the worldwide pandemic, it is essential to be able to perform most actions online. Going to the doctor is no exception since it often takes hours of waiting in line for an appointment, not to mention the medical staff struggles. To relieve this situation, the Equal studio designed a medical SaaS platform.</strong></div>

            <h3>Visual style</h3>

        <div class="slide-wrap">  <p class="slide-up">To simplify the process of creating a profile, the designers split a registration form into several sections. Moreover, they implemented a sidebar including some tips on filling the form. Another useful function is a medication tracker that helps to follow a treatment plan. To make an appointment booking more available, the team came up with a convenient system of filters, such as geolocation. That limited a selection of hospitals to the nearest ones considering a user location.</p>

They also added a calendar so that doctors could check their appointments. Afterward, the database was implemented so that a doctor could see all the previous diagnoses and tests of a patient.</p>

  <div class="slide-wrap">  <p class="slide-up">As the Equal designers had to deal with the data-heavy project, the decision of using a dashboard came naturally. It was necessary to create such a UI system that would prevent conflict between numerous elements. That was achieved by using a limited number of colors as well as text styles resulting in a clean design with lots of space. As the project comprises a great number of figures, the designers developed illustrative infographics. Among other features of the healthcare platform there are booking diagnostic tests such as full-body scans, chat with doctors, uploading medical certificates, receiving official prescriptions, and so on.</p>

<div class="slide-wrap">
      <strong class="slide-up">One of the greatest advantages of telehealth is that it minimizes face-to-face contact between patients and doctors which is a must during COVID-19, not to mention other dangerous diseases. There is no need to go to see a doctor to receive needed medicine. Now you can get your prescription online much safer and faster. Thus, this product is relevant and will be developing in the future.</strong>
