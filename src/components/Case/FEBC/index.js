We needed to learn about the present platform's functionality and the aims of its users while concurrently creating the platform's navigation structure so that we would be able better to comprehend the current platform's functionality and user needs.

            <h3>Users Scenarios and a New Navigation Architecture <br/> Were Created in This Project</h3>
            <p>
As soon as we completed the navigation architecture for the previous platform, we arranged a video meeting with the customer to show him the finished product and clarify any unclear aspects. We've already sorted out many issues that will come in handy as we move forward. We also discussed and agreed on the future steps of our work simultaneously. The steps and actions we took are outlined below:
Speculate on  User's specific cases;
Set up a platform-specific navigational map to make the work easier;
We start working on the user's specific case immediately after the client's approval.

            <h3>Interacting with Users</h3>
            <p>
To create User Scenarios, the company provided us with a text document containing small User Interviews of its management members. To be successful, we needed to know how many user personas we had and their key goals.

As a result of the scenarios, we've identified seven key stakeholders who will engage with the platform: two distinct types of Managers, Administrators, Clients, Suppliers, Operators, and Inspectors. Based on this, we set out to create a new platform map that considers all the specifics for each sort of user.

          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Involvement of Client's Representatives</h3>
            <p>
We were able to make adjustments as we went along to guarantee that we were meeting our client's needs and those of its target audience by engaging with our client and the people who would be using this product. Using this strategy, we were able to complete the map in the shortest amount of time feasible, learn more about our product, and lay the basis for future advancement.

Following the client's approval of the plan and idea, they began constructing the wireframes. The conclusion led to the deployment of the Material Design framework and concepts. Because of this, the development and design teams were able to work together more effectively.
            
Wireframes for logging in, forgetting passwords, the main dashboard, and onboarding were the first to be completed.

            <h3>Visualizing the Whole Idea</h3>
            <p>
Afterward, we got to work designing these screens to help the customer confirm the visual direction. For this project, all screen elements were contained in a set of screen overlays. After the customer had approved one of the aesthetic concepts, we got to work on the rest of the screens for the app. To avoid spending time and money on the wireframe stage, we decided on colors and fonts based on the visual guidelines and approved them straight away, allowing us to build ready-made displays quickly. </p>

            <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
            <p>
Because of the product's size and the difficulty in tracking the various scenarios, we've had to face challenges we hadn't anticipated while working on the platform. However, we could not discover other flows without conducting extensive testing within the company and with management themselves. Our screens may be interrupted, and we could go back to adding new components to our sitemap or developing another flow for a process. As a result, we better understood this issue and were better prepared for subsequent testing.</p>

            <p>
We generated clickable prototypes to make it easier to test the product. As a result, users could interact with the product in real-time without incurring any development costs. Other screens and functions could also be tracked and mapped out for future reference by a developer's team.</p>

        <ol>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <p>
In working on the platform, the client requested the creation of a mobile application for inspection. The main idea is that the inspectors can control which items have already been delivered and which are expected. The inspector also can communicate in the application about the goods, track and mark defects, and much more. Also, the main idea and task for us were to ensure the compatibility of the mobile application and the desktop platform. The manager could start the inspection from the computer and complete it on the phone, or vice versa.</p>

            <p>
The product's development team also created virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) experiences. Using virtual reality glasses, managers and customers may tour the future hotel from the comfort of their workplace and monitor product delivery flow, as well as how they seem in the interior. A similar experience can be had on a mobile phone using AR technology. It was up to us to develop the best workable solutions when we started because the client had just a vague understanding of how he wanted it done.</p>

The product team was being developed simultaneously as us so that we could work closely together on this project. For each sprint, we transferred the prototype to development immediately following the testing phase. The usage of this strategy allowed us to complete the work product more quickly than we could have otherwise. All the developers' questions were answered via video and chat.

For the benefit of everyone involved in the project. We would create notes explaining in text form how this or that function should behave. If specific flows need to be improved later, you can learn more about how they work to remember the finer points when you return to them.</p>
