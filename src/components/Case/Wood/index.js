<div class="slide-wrap slide-up"> <strong>WoodWatch is an online store of watches and other products made of natural and environmentally friendly materials. Moreover, it is a youth eco-friendly brand that focuses on the modern man of today.<br/>
WoodWatch started with just 3 models in 2013, one for males, one for females, and one unisex watch. Back in those times, the company developed within 5 team members only, while currently, after 7 years, more than 50 team members (having 10 different nationalities) are putting their efforts into a lifelong brand of wooden products.</strong></div>

        <div class="slide-wrap">
         <p class="slide-up">
        The client approached us for help in attracting a new audience and boosting their engagement. Along with the growth of traffic, there was a need to optimize the user experience. WoodWatch wanted to increase brand status, so they could keep on being the industry leader. Another goal was to increase the conversion rate on the website.
    </p>
    <p class="slide-up">Since the previous UI design was cluttered and needed an overhaul, we took into account all the client's wishes and requirements and proceeded to work. </p>

      <div class="slide-wrap">  <p class="slide-up">First and foremost we took a data-first approach in determining the pain points of the current store. For that purpose, we conducted business research in Google Analytics, analyzed the target audience, conducted an express site analysis, and set up data collection tools.
       </p>
       <p class="slide-up">
Our specialists also set up Hotjar and took a few weeks to collect the data we needed, watched videos of user interactions with the interface, gaining insight into the reasons behind the user's actions, and suggesting ways to simplify and improve the overall user experience. After analyzing this data we could identify the main patterns of user behavior and the main problematic stages of the interaction with the store.
       </p>
       <p class="slide-up">
We based all development steps on data from Google Analytics and Hotjar. </p></div>

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>The WW audience is divided into two almost equal parts, 49% women and 51% men. Based on this data, we decided to make the entrance to the catalog for two categories. Also, the audience is quite international. The highest amount of traffic comes from Italy, the UAE, the U.S. and the Netherlands. We put the language switch button in the foreground.

            <h3>Financial health score</h3>
            <p>
80 percent of the traffic comes from mobile devices, so we decided to work according to the Mobile-First method. Our experts developed the mobile version of the main flow. According to the heatmaps and videos of users' interaction with the interface, we realized that people do not notice the main Call-to-Action buttons on the product page, so we fixed the Add-to-cart button at the bottom of the screen while scrolling. This allows the user to add a product to the cart at any point of browsing the product page. </p>

            <h3>Visual part</h3>
            <p>
WoodWatch's big draw is a large number of high-quality product photos and videos. Our specialists emphasized the visual materials, so now the customer can see not only product photos but also real-life watch-on videos. We provided a clear and legible split with large-scale product images. </p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Buy faster
</h3>
            <p>
According to Google Analytics, returning visitors buy 14% more often than new visitors. We integrated the Add-to-Favorites feature, so  the customer can add a product to his favorites. When the user returns to the site, he can see the product he liked. By going to Favorites you can immediately find a previously saved product and buy it.
</p>
<p>
Our specialists have divided the catalog into 4 main categories: men's watches, women's watches, men's sunglasses, and women's sunglasses. Navigation was too cumbersome, so we suggested switching between collections already in the catalog as "Instagram stories" and attached to the top tabs, this allows the user to shift quickly between collections and view more products, so the chance that the customer will find the right product, add it to the shopping cart and buy it increases significantly.</p>

      <strong>We have been working with WoodWatch since May 2020 and our company established close collaboration with the client, have improved the performance and customer experience on their e-commerce website, upgraded, redesigned their platform, and redesigned their UI / UX. Thus, all sections of the site that affect conversion rates were redesigned: the home page, catalog, checkout flow, and other pages of the online store.
</strong>
<strong>The redesign has also significantly improved the site's conversion rate. The team continues to work with the client for further improvements and optimization.</strong>
