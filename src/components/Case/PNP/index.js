<div class="slide-wrap slide-up"> <strong>This is the MVP for a global micropayments network to be launched initially in Europe. pingNpay is a payments network designed to make paying for small items both viable and easy to use, for little things online and in person, including being designed to serve web3.0 and metaverse commerce. Specifically designed for the next evolution of the internet, pingNpay makes it easier and cheaper to buy and sell online services both now and in the future.
The video case study summarizes the process of creating the mobile payment MVP – and is perfect if you’re pushed for time.<br/>   <br/> 
As part of this project, we designed wallet interfaces (mobile and web browsers), a web application (app) for the administrator's dashboard, and a promotional website for a wide range of pingNpay stakeholders including users, wallet providers, regulators and investors. Below we describe the brief, challenges and workflow of creating a mobile payments interface.</strong></div>

     <div class="slide-wrap">
     <p class="slide-up">To ensure that the application is suitable for mass use, we needed to anticipate and design for users’ needs from the beginning, these included:</p>
<ul class="list slide-up">
<li>Highlight the functionality used most often on the home screen</li></br>
<li>Work within a payment limit of ~$20, which is the maximum transaction value</li></br>
<li>Ensure the app is visually appealing without losing its simplicity and functionality</li></br>
<li>Develop a smooth flow for requests for payment and refunds, so users can execute transactions without unnecessary clicks and redundant notifications from the system.</li>

          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>1. Getting to know our clients</h3>
            <p>
            We discussed their brief, requirements and expectations. At this stage we identified the main project requirements and development strategy.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>2. Conducting research</h3>
            <div class="slide-wrap">
            <p class="slide-up">To better understand the market, shape the mission and set clear goals, we conducted research. It helped us formulate the key differences between pingNpay and its competitors as follows:</p>
       <ul class="list slide-up">
       <li>Quick and simple registration that does not require personal identification documents within regulatory limits for low-value payments</li>
       <li>Viable fees for low-value payments</li>
       <li>Functionality that allows users to assess the reliability of recipients using reviews.</li>
       </ul>
       <p>
       <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>3. Devising the navigation map for the app</h3>
            <p>
            Based on the data from our client and the results obtained during the research, we created a Navigation Map for the app. This helped us organize the information, devise a roadmap of future developments as well as scope the work.</br> </br>Through a series and iterations and deeper dive exploration sessions, we clarified the vision for the app, allowing us to work through the details together including additional clarification about UK financial regulatory constraints. As a result, we arrived at seven main flows, on which we continued to evolve.</p>
            <div> </br> </br></br></br>
            <div class="parallax appear"> <img src=${architecture} alt="" /></div>
            <h3>4. Initial wireframing for priority pages</h3>
            <p>
            Based on the Navigation Map, initial wireframes were created, highlighting functions that users would perform most often. We analysed user behaviour, compiled a list of features that were required, and positioned them on the home screen.</br> </br>

            When logging into the app, users have high-priority information to hand including information on their balance, deposit or withdraw functions and how to make or receive a payment.</br> </br>

            To make quick payments, we brought users to the home screen, strongly highlighting the easiest payment methods - QR code functionality.</br> </br>

            Among the other important sections here, we also outlined payment and receipt of funds, which form the main components of this app.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="parallax appear"> <img src=${wireframes} alt="" /></div>

          </li>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
          <h3>5. Testing wireframes in-house and among the target audience</h3>
          <div class="slide-wrap">
          <p class="slide-up">To evaluate the wireframes, we prepared specific tasks that ordinary users had to perform and a clickable prototype to test user behaviour and the usability of information blocks.</br>

          We watched user behaviour during these tasks and noted for ourselves the points that still needed to be improved. Among them were the following:</p>
     <ul class="list slide-up">
     <li>Thinking about clearer and simpler descriptions for the buttons and adding visual accents</li>
     <li>Bringing balance actions to the main screen.</li>
     </ul>
            <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>6. Studying feedback and defining the best option</h3>
            <p>
            After testing, users additionally left feedback about app concepts, details that were unclear, or things they really thought were relevant and important.</br>
            After studying the feedback from all users, we were not only able to choose the options that led to the desired goal faster, but also identify users' preferences and expectations early on to improve our designs immediately.</p>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
          <h3>7. Studying the preferences of the app's target audience</h3>
          <div class="slide-wrap">
          <p class="slide-up">Even at the stage of getting to know the client, we learned that young people, millennials in particular, were a key early adaptor audience for the app.</br>
          So before creating concepts for the app, we studied the preferences of the target audience regarding UI design and highlighted the main tasks that it should solve. The main conclusions from the study were as follows:
          </p>
          </div></br> </br></br></br>
          <div class="parallax appear"> <img src=${pnp4} alt="" /></div>
           <div>       
     <ul class="list slide-up">
     <li><h3>Digital natives</h3>
     Millennials are people with non-standard and flexible minds, living life at a fast pace. They have never known a time pre-internet, are always online, and are used to consuming a huge, near-constant stream of information. They know how to do several things at the same time, think about numerous things at once, and are not inclined to sit in one place.</li>
     <li><h3>Mobile-first</h3>
     Millennials are active internet users (5-15 hours of surfing per day). They decide quickly about the convenience of apps and do not want to spend time understanding complex interfaces.</li>
<li><h3>Usability</h3>
For Millennials, great usability and a modern interface are also important. Because millennials are respectful of brands, they also pay close attention to the branding of all of the company's digital projects.</li>
     </ul>
          </div>
          <h3>UI design summary:</h3>
     <ul class="list slide-up">
     <li>Create a clear, non-overloaded design, and intuitive interface</li>
     <li>Use of visual elements and colour styles to clarity and confidence</li>
     <li>Balance current trends and long-term design for the app</li>
     <li>Make complicated things simple</li>
     <li>Leverage emotional design techniques through interactions, user-friendly tips, and pop-ups</li>
     <li>Focus on the needs of the target audience (millennials love the opportunity to be unique!)</li>
     </ul>
     </br> </br></br></br>
          <div class="parallax appear"> <img src=${pnp5} alt="" /></div>
          <h3>8. Defining the UI concept of the app</h3>
          <p>
          Based on the data collected during the UI preferences study, we prepared a presentation with the concepts that best fit the requirements. After discussion with the client, we refined the one that best demonstrated the idea and emphasized the important functionality of the app.</p>
        <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
        <h3>9. Continuing to design using the selected concept</h3>
        <p>
        Afterwards, we moved on to designing subsequent pages without preparing wireframes in advance. This helped us immediately understand the look of the final product and saved time during both the design and development processes, which is very important when working on an MVP.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
      <h3>10. Working on revisions and improvements</h3>
      <p>
      After completing each flow, we discussed the work with the client, briefed them on possible atypical situations, considered options for improvement, and made revisions.
      <div>Constant communication with the client made it possible to identify the nuances that needed to be improved or anticipated in the shortest possible time.</div></p>
            <h3>11. Developing clear onboarding and page tips to level out the complexities of the app</h3>
        <p>
        Any new entrant to the market must-have features that will set it apart from others. It's important to identify the benefits early on and use that information to promote it.</br>
        On the app side, it's important to emphasise these features at the very beginning, so we devised a stand-out onboarding flow and tips on some pages of the app to enhance the user experience.</p>
        </br> </br></br></br>
        <div class="parallax appear"> <img src=${pnp6} alt="" /></div>   
                  <h3>12. Transferring the files to development</h3>
        <p>
        After half of the app was ready, the development team joined us and began developing the finished flows. For convenience, we left necessary explanations and details about some pages in the layout.</p>
      <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
                  <h3>13. Interactive prototypes for all the flows</h3>
        <p>
        A prototype is necessary to make it easy to test and get a feel for how the final product will be used. Moreover, it certainly helped the developers understand all the interactions in the app.</p>
      <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
                  <h3>14. Description of basic functionality and pages</h3>
        <p>
        <div>       
        <ul class="list slide-up">
        <li><h3>Home page</h3>
        The home page was created after testing the wireframes. To make a final decision, we created three variants of the home page, worked out additional pages for the prototype, and sent it to a group of users for testing. After receiving feedback, we determined the functions of higher priority and importance.</li>
        <li><h3>Payment flow</h3>
        We've put together on one page all the options which may help the user to make a payment. They can choose the recipient from their list of contacts or favourites, enter the data for payment manually or use a QR code. There are two options for using QR codes, either users can either scan the code or show their own QR code to pay in store.</li>
        </br> </br></br></br>
        <div class="parallax appear"> <img src=${pnp7} alt="" /></div>     
   <li><h3>Flow of sending a payment request</h3>
   To create a request for payment, the user has several options using QR codes. Here we have provided an opportunity to create a dynamic code. It allows users to set the amount they wish to receive.</br></br>

   PingNpay is aimed at both consumers and retailers, facilitating fee mechanism for both person to person and person to business based payments, the UI deals with these complex items by making it simple for the user.</br></br>
   
   Creating a static QR code has wider application and can be used for any funds transfer. Users can save the QR code as a JPEG, share it in a convenient messenger or just show it to another person for scanning. Additionally, the user can create a link to the request with the destination and the expected sum of money.</br></br>
   
   Such a choice of variants gives users the opportunity to find the most convenient way to carry out any transactions.</li>
   </br> </br></br></br>
   <div class="parallax appear"> <img src=${pnp8} alt="" /></div>    
   <li><h3>Request status control</h3>
   With the ability to send a request for funds and refunds, a new task arose to display information about these requests in the most accurate and comprehensive way possible. We created several options for testing and chose the most optimal one for each situation.</br></br>

   We developed statuses that would change dynamically as soon as a decision was made on a request. They may be pending, request paid, rejected. Requests have their own pending period and in cases when a decision should be made quickly, we warn users with additional prompts.</br>

   Thus, we prevent users from being overloaded with notifications and confused by unnecessary information.</li>
        </ul>

     <div class="slide-wrap slide-up"><h2 class="slide-up">Conclusion</h2></div>
<div class="slide-wrap">
      <strong class="slide-up">Through rapid prototyping, regular concept testing and close client engagement we managed to design the MVP Mobile wallet in around five working weeks. During this time, we prepared eight flows, and a total of 180 screens. For the MVP, we worked out the main functionality that users will use first and foremost in detail. And, of course, we considered user behaviour in all possible scenarios.</br>

      We're confident that this MVP has a huge chance of success among the users and already have plans for further development of the project.  We believe in the products we create and go the extra mile to give our partners the best result.</strong>
