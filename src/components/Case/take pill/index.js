<div class="slide-wrap slide-up"> <strong>Taking pills could be an ordeal for patients if there is no accurate system for tracking that. It is only natural that eventually, designers came up with an idea of a pill reminder app. It is a pity though that it hasn’t changed much since that time, and that is where the Equal web studio saw a chance to train and test its team.</strong></div>

<div>
  <div class="slide-wrap slide-up"><h2 class="slide-up">Mission</h2></div>
  <div class="slide-wrap"><p class="slide-up">Even though the TakePill mobile app still stays relevant, its functionality and design are far from being up-to-date. The Equal’s team decided to accept the challenge and to develop a new modern version to:<br /></p>
    <ul class="list slide-up">

    <li>gain users & attract a new customer base;</li>
<li>make it IoT-powered (i.e. the connection with Apple Watch so it will be possible to observe health status in the TakePill mobile app).</li>
    </ul></div>

      <div>
        <div class="slide-wrap slide-up"><h2 class="slide-up">Outcome</h2></div>
        <div class="slide-wrap">  <p class="slide-up">After conducting thorough research including competitor analysis, the study of best practices, user pain points, and ways of solving them, Equal developed 18 screens showing both redesigned and added features. As a result, the app became more likely to be downloaded as it has attractive visuals, personalized content, and, all the more, solves a wider range of problems.</p>

      <div class="slide-wrap slide-up"><h2 class="slide-up">Design Process</h2></div>
     <div class="parallax appear">  <img  src=${p3} alt="" /></div>
<div>
        <ol>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Competitor analysis</h3>
            <p>
Adopting already working practices and improving them is essential, and the Equal web design studio took time and pains to find and distinguish elements that could have been useful for the project.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Determination of pain points</h3>
            <p>
The average user age got younger, so did the requirements for an app. Today apps are expected to be multi-purpose. Moreover, the ways in which users interact with apps have improved to the level of becoming intuitive, that’s why the design system of TakePill had to be changed to meet those expectations.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Creating wireframes</h3>
            <p>
The wireframes were designed to detect possible flaws and thus save time during the next steps.</p>
          </li>
           <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>UI conceptualization</h3>
            <p>
The final decisions were based on the presumed pool of clients consisting of males and females of young and middle age. Their common preferences were: pleasant to eye colors, clear design, readable texts. Therefore, as custom illustrations proved to evoke positive reactions, a themed set was created using the technology of 3d modeling.</p>
          </li>
           <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
            <p>
Final drafts were animated to create a clickable prototype for the ultimate testing and bug fixing.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

           <div class="parallax appear">  <img  src=${p4} alt="" /></div>

        <div class="slide-wrap slide-up"><h2 class="slide-up">Solutions</h2></div>
        <div class="slide-wrap">  <p class="slide-up">The UX was improved through the implementation of modern interaction patterns (button position, what it does, etc.). The procedure of adding a new remedy was significantly simplified. Now it takes twice as little time and includes convenient features such as choosing an icon for a different medication. In doing so, the designers killed two birds with one stone: they ensured that users would not confuse the prescribed preparations and spiced up the process by transforming it in a sort of mini-game.</p>

    <div class="parallax appear">  <img  src=${p5} alt="" /></div>
    <div>
      <div class="slide-wrap">
      <p class="slide-up">The user experience also leveled up thanks to new features, such as:</p>
<ul class="list slide-up">
<li>Messenger for users and doctors;</li>
<li>Booking an appointment with the doctor;</li>
<li>user and doctor profiles with essential data;</li>
<li>Synchronization with Apple Watch to track health condition;</li>
<li>Related articles section;</li>
<li>Simple app usage guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p class="slide-up">The UI part had changed drastically due to the complete transformation of:</p>
<ul class="list slide-up">
<li>color palette;</li>
<li>icon renovation;</li>
<li>design style;</li>
<li> 3d illustration implementation.</li>
</ul>

    </div>
     <div class="slide-wrap slide-up"><h2 class="slide-up">Results</h2></div>
<div class="slide-wrap">
      <strong class="slide-up">Equal saw the potential in an outdated app and went for an experiment. They made it their final goal to equip the app with a new clean UI, make UX better by using a step-by-step secure strategy, and, finally, fully develop the TakePill app’s potential. All the goals were achieved. For now, the project is internal and hasn’t launched yet but there is hope it will come in useful again someday.</strong>
