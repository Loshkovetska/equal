Going to the doctor is no exception since it often takes hours of waiting in line for an appointment, not to mention the medical staff struggles.

        <div class="slide-wrap slide-up"><h2 class="slide-up">Deciding on a strategy</h2></div>
        <div class="slide-wrap">  <p class="slide-up">Initially, our two main focus points were:</p>
<ul class="list slide-up"><li>To make it highly visible before and after the app is launched;</li>
<li>To make people use the app regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="slide-up">The first objective was to be achieved by creating promotional material for the campaign. To accomplish the second goal, we needed to create a system of different notifications and triggers that would draw users’ attention and encourage them to use the application.</p>

          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Planning on the functionality</h3>
            <p>

After completing competitor analysis, we went on to create user scenarios to plan on a design system and think of possible features.  </p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Introducing users to apps
</h3>
            <p>
The first thing we stumbled across was that even though all apps followed pretty much similar patterns and were no longer difficult to understand, our particular project was still unusual and could hardly be called intuitive. As a result, we designed 3 onboarding screens so that a user got to know immediately the purpose of the app. Later on, we created an engaging animation for the splash screen. The registration procedure was followed by simple instructions so that there wouldn’t be any confusion.</p>
          </li>
           <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>User flow</h3>
            <p>

On passing the first challenges, we thought through the whole path of our user personas including inserting personal data, setting up their goals, inviting friends, and, finally, making pledges. Users can bet on everything related to sports activity: running, riding a bike, burning calories, and so on. </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
             <div class="parallax appear"> <img src=${pled3} alt="" /></div>

      <div>
        <ol>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>UX testing</h3>
            <p>
Once the list of all screens was finalized, we got down to creating wireframes. We designed all pages featuring functions mentioned above and even added a few more, such as a map page, forms, pop-ups, etc. </p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Color system</h3>
            <p>
Now when the logic proved to be working perfectly, we started developing a UI system. The palette we chose comprised rather subtle colors, as we were to stick to brand colors. The only exception was clickable elements like CTAs and links. In doing so, we created a visible hierarchy of elements by using colors. We also created a series of fresh unique illustrations. </p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Getting approval</h3>
            <p>
At this point, we showed the client the interactive prototype. Thus, we received feedback and made some improvements before the project proceeded to the development stage. Throughout the whole project we’ve been collaborating with the team of developers providing them with the project assets and the help they needed.</p>

          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Pre-launch app promotion</h3>
            <p>
To launch this massive changes app successfully, we provided our client with a number of advertising banners and designed email offers to help gain potential users. We also created a landing page that could be integrated with special tools for targeting ads, checking the page traffic, and so on.  </p>
          </li>
          <li class="slide-wrap slide-up">
            <h3>Keeping the users’ motivation high</h3>
            <p>

To consider the app thriving, we needed to make sure that users would use it as often as possible. Thus, apart from all the features mentioned above, we created various triggers such as reminders of pledges, diverse notifications, a system of awards and achievements. </p>

      <strong class="slide-up">We developed the web and mobile versions of the app practically from scratch, worked out the user experience strategy in full, and found the most suitable design solution, which allowed the project to enter the market with new features attracting more users.</strong>
